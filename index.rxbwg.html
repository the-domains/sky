Called as Hand-Tech, the wearable device is a semi-transparent glove covering your hand from the wrist, right up to the two fingers and thumb. The fabric of Hand-Tech glove is woven with sensors and miniscule projectors that identify the hand's movement and then translate the action into the requisite function, with or without the 3D projection. One can take pictures, zoom-in or zoom-out, record videos, prop up particular apps and more using the glove in real-time. Combining virtual and real world environment into one, the Hand-Tech glove is also capable of translating sign language of deaf people into sound pattern of spoken language. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="124"><p>The basic idea of this concept glove is to convert sign language into gestures that save time and also bring up an augmented reality interface that paves way for the future. Some examples of this glove's application are 3D projection by pointing a finger in any direction, data exchange by simply shaking hands or simply bringing up a virtual watch by making a gesture to hold one.
