# New And Interesting Industrial Design Concepts That Will Amaze You

Industrial designers surprise us once in a while with new designs which amaze us either with their function or their style and sometimes with both. A selection of these courageous designs are included in this article. We all look at them with hope that one day these concepts or something similar will be created.

This is such a versatile disposable smartphone in form of a booklet made of smart material. The whole idea based on this future material - cheap compacted mix that includes a base (something like cardboard), and the "smart" nanoparticles that can uniting in various combinations to create computing power, microphones, speakers, displays and etc.

Booklet can be various lengths and computational volume. You can detach the sheets and each sheet will be a full-featured smartphone with a 100% visualizing surface and computational power reduced in proportion to the total volume of the booklet.

The Rising Table concept is part of the Rising...furniture formula that finds its roots in the Rising Chair. This means that once again, the origins of this design can be traced back to the rather simple idea of starting with a flat surface that is capable of transforming into a piece of stylishly designed furniture. In designing the Rising Table, I felt it was of paramount importance that the source materials both dictated and guided the ultimate design, while ensuring practical appliance and usability.
