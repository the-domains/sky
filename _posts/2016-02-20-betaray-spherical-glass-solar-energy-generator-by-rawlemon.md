**last year, german architect [andré broessel of rawlemon][0] presented designboom with his [spherical glass solar energy generator concept][1] in its early prototyping stages.** developed as a stand-alone power charger station for electro-mobility, the project uses the advantageous strategy of implementing a ball lens and specific geometrical structure to improve energy efficiency by 35% when compared to existing photo-voltaic panels. by combining symmetrical and transparent spherical geometry as a concentrator lens and emitter, the unique dual axis tracking system can be fully incorporated into any building surface, improving existing efficiency and offering up to 99% transparency.

_'in addition to increased and optimum solar performance, the design offers benefits for users, designers and architects,'_ explains broessel. _'unlike any existing solar technology, the design and its dematerialized aesthetic permits high transparency and full building integration with no weather impact, due to its dual axis tracking system. the design allows the possibility to connect both standard and hybrid collectors in order to convert electricity and/or thermal energy, offering a scalable, reversible, self-sufficient system.'_

**in contrast to its traditional photo-voltaic 'dual-axis' counterparts, the generator incorporates a fully rotational weatherproof natural optical tracking device that is adequate for functioning on inclined surfaces and curtain walls, empowering any building surface.** the new solar generating concept even has the capability to concentrate diffused daylight or moonlight for a more effective site context application. on a cloudy day, the device produces 4 times more energy than a conventional PV system.

**the unit comes with a modular collector system that charges and stores energy both night and day.** by reducing the silicon cell area to 25% with a transparent liquid filled sphere point focusing concentrator, the collector module can be expanded with a stirling engine to generate surplus electricity.
