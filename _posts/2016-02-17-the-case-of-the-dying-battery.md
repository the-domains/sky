# The Case Of the Dying Battery&excl;

The Mini Power is a very clever design-tech that comes to the rescue at the right moment! Based on researches, people run out of charger on their Smartphone, just when they need it the most. The Mini Power is based on the Paper battery technology and is designed to be a much smaller volume portable charger. It has small capacity which is just enough for urgent use.

There are four kinds of capacity to choose from: 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours. People can buy it from convenience stores. It can be simply recycled at the store just like a normal battery.

Mini Power is a 2014 [Red Dot Awards: Design Concept][0] winner.

Designer: Tsung Chih-Hsien
