# 3D Printed Wooden Wedges
[![](http://i.imgur.com/6ach4ax.jpg)][0]

This is not really a new project just a quick variation I was playing around with. These are the wedges I made for the Wu Ying Heels but without the drawer. This makes the shoes much more practical to resize and wear. As promised the files can be downloaded here: [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1009253][1]

I printed these with a wood based filament. I used .3 layer height, 20% infill but I would suggest .2 since it took forever to sand. I used a Chinese brand but woodFill and Laywoo are common brand names for this kind of filament in the West. I think it is roughly 30-40% wood and the rest plastic (PLA). It smells like wood when you print with it and the final object feels like wood.

This is what the printed shoe looked like before sanding- much too rough.

No making fun of my arms. I know I'm a twig. Trying to eat more... Following some instructions I found online I sanded with 180, 240, 320, 400 and then 600 grit sandpaper.

I've never worked with wood of any kind before. After this I'm not so sure I will again. It took me hours to sand the shoes smooth. I forgot to wear a mask for the very fine sanding so was sneezing out plastic and sawdust for a couple days. 3D printing is normally a nice clean hobby. Wood is quite messy and tiring...

I left just a little bit of a grain to it so it did not look like molded plastic. It's a bit random so worked out well.

I found the proper material for rubber soles online. The other rubber I used on the Wu Ying shoes was too thin and the shock traveled up my legs when I walked quickly on them.

I was going to do my toenails but the foot-fetish guys got a little creepy last time so maybe this will scare them off...

I guessed with the wood finish since I'd never used any before. Came out a little orange on the test pieces but I didn't want to buy another can so went ahead. Looks ok.

The 3D printed wood \*feels\* great- just like wood. Very warm and much better for shoes than the plastic I used before. Tactilely it's definitely the best material I've printed.

The shoes are comfortable. I have pads but they felt better without them. No problem at all walking in them. See video here: [http://sendvid.com/jkiis66m][11] I might print out another pair with a bit more arch support but mostly because I can. If I bought them at the store I'd be satisfied with the fit. I have very narrow feet and this is the first time I've actually had shoes precisely the correct width.

This whole project, while satisfactory left me feeling that someone who really knew what they were doing like a professional shoemaker or even a real woodworker, could do something amazing with this. Still, it's pretty good for a first attempt with anything wood related and a decent sample to upload with the 3D files.
