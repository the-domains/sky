# Wedge Sandal by SexyCyborg

As requested, these are similar to my Wu Ying sandals but without the drawer. I printed these with wood filament and then sanded and finished them. Pictures of that are here: [http://imgur.com/a/uAFjf][0]

They are certainly wearable- at least as much as any store bought sandals the same height. Short video of them being worn here: [http://sendvid.com/jkiis66m][1]

You can edit the file on TinkerCad here: [https://tinkercad.com/things/gU8pC4ZNky4][2]  
Remember to "ungroup" the strap-holes before you resize it. Also by scaling on the Z axis alone you can lower them to a height you are comfortable with. After you are happy with the changes use the "Mirror" function to make the left shoe.

Wood filament .3 layer height, 20% infill but I would suggest .2 since it took forever to sand. 

Sanded with 180, 240, 320, 400 and 600 grit sandpaper. Then finished. Two coats. Three would probably be better.
