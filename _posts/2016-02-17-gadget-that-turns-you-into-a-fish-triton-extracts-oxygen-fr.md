# Gadget that turns you into a FISH&colon; Triton extracts oxygen from water

* Concept gadget has arms which branch out to the side and work as gills 
* Material on these two arms conceal tiny holes where water is sucked in 
* Chambers inside separate the oxygen and release the water so that the user can breathe continuously while swimming

It's the James Bond gadget on everyone's wishlist. 

The rebreather, a system that lets you breathe underwater, has got Mr Bond out of some tricky situations. 

Now one South Korean designer Korea has taken inspiration from the spy's device to create a concept gadget that claims to instantly transform the user into a human fish. 

The mask, dubbed Triton, acts like a fish gill to extract oxygen from water so that the user can keep on breathing while under the sea. 

While it may not be as slick as a rebreather, designer Jeabyun Yeon, who came up with the concept, believes it will change the way people approach water. 

To use Triton, swimmers would bite down on a plastic mouth piece. 

Two arms, which branch out to the sides of the scuba mask, can then function as efficient gills to deliver oxygen. 

The scaly texture on the arms conceal small holes in the material where water is sucked in. 

Chambers inside separate the oxygen and release the liquid so that the user can breathe comfortably in the ocean. 

Using a very small but powerful micro compressor, the concept system would compress oxygen and store it in tanks. 

The entire gadget is powered by micro battery which is around 30 times smaller than a current battery that can quickly charge 1,000 times faster. 

But you may have to wait a little longer before placing an order as the product is still at concept stage. 

Mr Yeon describes it as 'a future product' that could one day replace complicated scuba equipment.
